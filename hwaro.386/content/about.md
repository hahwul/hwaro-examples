### The 386 Era

The Intel 386 processor, released in 1985, was a milestone in personal computing. It brought 32-bit computing to the masses and ran operating systems like MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, and early Linux distributions. The distinctive blue screens, monospace fonts, and text-mode interfaces of that era remain iconic in computing history.
