## Why Retro Computing Matters

There's something deeply satisfying about the visual aesthetics of early computing. The blue screens, blinking cursors, and monospace fonts of the DOS era carry a charm that modern flat design often lacks.

## The DOS Aesthetic

The MS-DOS interface was defined by constraints:

- **16 colors** - The classic CGA/EGA palette
- **Text mode** - 80x25 characters
- **Monospace fonts** - Every character occupying the same width
- **Box-drawing characters** - Creating "GUIs" with text

These constraints bred creativity. Developers and designers made remarkable interfaces within these limitations.

## Color Palette of an Era

The classic DOS color palette:

| Color       | Code | Hex       |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| Black       | 0    | `#000000` |
| Blue        | 1    | `#0000AA` |
| Green       | 2    | `#00AA00` |
| Cyan        | 3    | `#00AAAA` |
| Red         | 4    | `#AA0000` |
| Magenta     | 5    | `#AA00AA` |
| Brown       | 6    | `#AA5500` |
| Light Gray  | 7    | `#AAAAAA` |

## The 386 Revolution

The Intel 80386 processor, introduced in 1985, was a game-changer:

- First x86 processor with **32-bit** architecture
- Supported **virtual memory** and **multitasking**
- Ran at 12-33 MHz
- Enabled protected mode for modern OS features

The 386 era was when personal computing truly began to flourish, and its visual language remains iconic.
