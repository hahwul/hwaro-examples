Welcome to my blog! This is the first post on my new site powered by Hwaro and the Hermit theme.

## Why Hwaro?

[Hwaro](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro) is a fast and lightweight static site generator written in Crystal. It's designed to be simple yet powerful:

- **Fast builds** - Crystal's compiled nature makes it blazing fast
- **Simple configuration** - TOML-based config that's easy to understand
- **Markdown content** - Write your posts in familiar Markdown syntax
- **Flexible templates** - Jinja2 templating for full customization

## What to Expect

I'll be sharing thoughts on programming, tools, and technology. Stay tuned for more posts!
