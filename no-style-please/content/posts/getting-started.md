+++

Setting up a site with Hwaro and this theme is straightforward.

## Quick start

1. Install [Hwaro](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro)
2. Create a new site: `hwaro new my-site`
3. Copy the no-style-please theme files into your project
4. Run `hwaro serve` to preview

## Adding content

Create Markdown files in the `content/` directory:

- `content/about.md` — standalone pages
- `content/posts/my-post.md` — blog posts (with `date` in front matter)

## Configuration

Edit `config.toml` to change your site title, description, and other settings. The theme keeps configuration minimal — just like everything else.
