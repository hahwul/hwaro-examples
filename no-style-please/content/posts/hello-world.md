Welcome to the **no-style-please** theme for Hwaro. This is a minimalist theme that uses almost no CSS.

## Why minimalism?

A minimal theme loads fast, works everywhere, and keeps the focus on content. No fancy animations, no heavy frameworks — just text.

## What you get

- Monospace typography
- Dark mode support via CSS `filter: invert(1)`
- Simple post listing with dates
- Back-to-home navigation on every page

That's it. Nothing more, nothing less.
