## about me

Hello! This is a simple whitespace-themed portfolio and blog, built with Hwaro.

The theme is inspired by the *-folio* design — clean, minimal, and focused on content. It uses serif typography for readability, generous whitespace for breathing room, and a monochromatic palette to keep things distraction-free.

## what i do

I enjoy working at the intersection of design and technology. Whether it's building web applications, crafting interfaces, or writing about the process — I believe in keeping things simple and letting the work speak for itself.

## colophon

- Typography: Lora (serif) for body, system sans-serif for UI elements
