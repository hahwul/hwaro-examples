## this is a post with code

Here's a sample code block to demonstrate syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple function."""
    print("Hello from *folio!")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

You can use `inline code` as well within your regular text. The theme handles both elegantly with a clean, readable style.

## this is a post with images

Photography is a great way to capture moments. Below are some examples of how images look in this theme.

> The best camera is the one that's with you. — Chase Jarvis

Images are displayed at full width within the content area, maintaining their aspect ratio for a clean presentation.

## this is a post with formatted text and links

This post demonstrates various text formatting options. You can write in **bold**, *italic*, or even ***bold italic*** to emphasize your points.

Here's an unordered list:

- First item with a brief description
- Second item with some more context
- Third item to round things out

And an ordered list:

1. Read the documentation
2. Set up your project
3. Write great content
4. Ship it

You can also include [links to external sites](https://github.com) naturally within the flow of your writing. Blockquotes work beautifully too:
