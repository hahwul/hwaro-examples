Hello World! This is my first post using the Even theme for Hwaro.

## Why Even?

Even is a minimal theme that focuses on what matters most — your content. It provides:

- A distraction-free reading experience
- Clean typography optimized for readability
- Fast loading times with minimal CSS
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## What's Next?

I plan to write about:

1. Static site generators
2. Web development tips
3. Open source projects
4. Programming tutorials

Stay tuned for more content!
