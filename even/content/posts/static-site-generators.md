Static site generators (SSGs) have seen a surge in popularity in recent years. Let's explore why.

## What is a Static Site Generator?

A static site generator takes your content (usually written in Markdown), applies templates, and generates a complete static HTML website. No database, no server-side processing at runtime.

## Benefits

### Speed

Static sites are incredibly fast. There's no database query, no server-side rendering. Just plain HTML files served directly to the browser.

### Security

With no database and no server-side code execution, the attack surface is minimal. No SQL injection, no server vulnerabilities to worry about.

### Simplicity

Your entire site is a collection of files. You can version control everything with Git, deploy anywhere, and the tooling is straightforward.

### Cost

Static sites can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
