## The Challenge

Solaris Energy had outgrown their original identity. As they expanded from a local installer to a national provider, they needed a brand that communicated scale, trust, and innovation.

## Our Approach

We started with stakeholder interviews and competitive analysis, then developed three distinct creative directions. The winning concept centered on a dynamic sun motif that works across digital and print.

### Deliverables

- Primary and secondary logo system
- Color palette with accessibility-tested contrast ratios
- Typography system (headings + body)
- Brand guidelines document (48 pages)
- Marketing website redesign

## The Result

The new identity launched across all touchpoints within 8 weeks. Early feedback from the sales team indicated improved prospect engagement and brand recognition.

{{< testimonial name="Sarah Chen" role="CEO, Solaris Energy" quote="Studio didn't just give us a new logo — they gave us a brand that tells our story. The response from our customers and partners has been overwhelmingly positive." >}}

> The rebrand coincided with a 40% increase in qualified inbound leads over the following quarter.
