Pulse is a project management platform for modern teams, and our API lets you build powerful integrations and automations. Quick Start 1. Get your API key Sign in to your Pulse dashboard and navigate to Settings &gt; API Keys to generate a new key. 2. Make your first request curl -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY&quot; \\ https://api.pulse.dev/v1/users/me 3. Explore the API Guides Learn authentication, rate limiting, and error handling API Reference Explore all endpoints with request and response examples Base URL All API requests should be made to: https://api.pulse.dev/v1 Authentication Include your API key in the Authorization header: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY Response Format All responses are returned as JSON with consistent structure: { &quot;data&quot;: { ... }, &quot;meta&quot;: { &quot;request_id&quot;: &quot;req_abc123&quot;, &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2026-01-15T10:30:00Z&quot; } }","url":"/"},{"title":"Authentication","content":"Overview The Pulse API uses Bearer token authentication .
