We're thrilled to announce **FlowSync v2.0**, the biggest update since our launch. After months of user research, prototyping, and engineering work, we've rebuilt the entire platform from the ground up.

## What's New

### Redesigned Interface

The new UI is cleaner, faster, and more intuitive. We've reduced click paths by 40% for common actions and introduced a unified command palette for power users.

### Real-time Collaboration

Multiple team members can now edit the same board simultaneously. You'll see cursors, selections, and changes in real-time — just like Google Docs, but for project management.

### Performance

The entire frontend has been rebuilt with modern tooling:

- **60% faster** initial page load
- **3x faster** search across large workspaces
- **Offline mode** with automatic sync when back online

## Migration

Existing users will be automatically migrated to v2.0 over the next two weeks. No action is required — all your data, integrations, and settings will be preserved.

## What's Next

We're already working on v2.1, which will include:

- AI-powered task suggestions
- Advanced automation workflows
- Native mobile app refresh

Thanks to everyone who participated in our beta program. Your feedback shaped every pixel of this release.
