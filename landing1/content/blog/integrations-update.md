We've just shipped three of our most-requested integrations. FlowSync now connects seamlessly with **GitHub**, **Linear**, and **Notion**.

<!-- more -->

## GitHub

Sync pull requests, issues, and deployments directly to your FlowSync boards. When a PR is merged, the linked task automatically moves to "Done."

Key features:
- Two-way sync for issues and PRs
- Deployment status tracking
- Branch name auto-linking

## Linear

Already using Linear for issue tracking? No problem. FlowSync's Linear integration lets you view and manage Linear issues alongside your FlowSync tasks.

Key features:
- Import Linear projects as FlowSync boards
- Bi-directional status sync
- Label and priority mapping

## Notion

Embed Notion pages directly in FlowSync tasks, or create Notion docs from task descriptions with one click.

Key features:
- Notion page embeds in task details
- One-click doc creation
- Search across both platforms

## Setting Up

All three integrations are available now for Pro and Enterprise plans. Head to **Settings > Integrations** in your workspace to connect.

We're adding new integrations every month. [Let us know](mailto:hello@flowsync.app) which tools you'd like to see next.
