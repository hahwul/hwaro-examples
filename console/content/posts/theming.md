This theme supports automatic dark/light mode switching via the CSS `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

- **Dark mode**: Black background with light gray text (#DBDBDB)
- **Light mode**: White background with black text

No JavaScript required. The theme respects your operating system's appearance setting.

You can customize the color variables in `static/css/console.css` to create your own theme variant.
