# Hello, World!

This is a terminal-style theme for [Hwaro](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro), inspired by [jekyll-theme-console](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console).

It features a minimal, console-like design with monospace fonts and a dark color scheme that automatically switches to light mode based on your system preferences.
